Flatwing Commander is a 2-dimensional recreation of the classic "Wing Commander". 


	___ II ___ Languages and Libraries used 


Python 2.7
pygame 1.9.2 



	___ III ___ Status of the Project
The game is mostly playable. Custom missions and a small campaign are functional. 


What is still missing: 
- half of the ships don't have their own graphic model 
- saving and loading games
- the ai can only do basic maneuvers and is really dumb.
